# The Emkay Library
## Overview
The Emkay Library is a boutique collection of entertainment. Each year, The Library curates a list of 50 eccentric artists and offers the artists’ entire collection of books, music, and movies to be rented by its patrons. Although it’s a rather unique operation, The Emkay Library averages 5,000 rentals per year by its devoted group of 50 patrons. We need a way to store these rentals, as well as our patrons and artists. To solve this need, we are looking to create a database-driven website to record our *Item Rentals* of *Books*, *Albums*, and *Movies* by *Artists* to its *Patrons*.

## Recent Updates
**1/24/2021:**
- Fixed capitalization so ERD and Schema are consistent
- Changed Music to Albums
- Added another line in Overview to make it explicitly clear which problem we are attempting to solve.
- Changed ERD to show zero or many relationship (instead of one or many)
